# rheoThermTool

A toolbox to simulate of thermo-rheological fluid flows in OpenFOAM速.
It contains models for Viscoelastic fluids (VE) and Generalized Newtonian Fluids (GNF)
and the ability to change fluid properties according to temperature-dependent functions.

The `rheoThermTool` software has a framework which allows a user to choose if a quantity
(e.g. reference viscosity or thermal conductivity) is subjected to a thermal law
such as the Arrhenius equation.

The initial implementation for the non-newtonian fluid models
was based from the [rheoTool](https://github.com/fppimenta/rheoTool) toolbox.
The thermo-rheological aspects of the fluid models follows
the [Peters & Baaijens (1997, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.)](http://doi.org/10.1016/S0377-0257(96)01511-X)
framework for both the constitutive and energy equations.

This software was developed and tested using the [OpenFOAM-6](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-6) open source CFD toolbox from OpenFOAM Foundation.


## Features

Fluid models available:
* VE fluid models: Oldroyd-B, Giesekus, PTT exponential or linear.
* GNF fluid models: Power Law, Carreau-Yasuda and the standard Newtonian stress tensor.

Thermal functions available:
* Williams-Landel-Ferry equation.
* Arrhenius equation.
* Linear fit.
* Constant (i.e. no temperature dependency).

Other Characteristics
* Fully-parallelized solver.
* Generic grids for 2D/3D problems.
* Solvers support either moving or static meshes.
* Transient flow solvers are highly stable regarding pressure-stress-velocity coupling.


## To be implemented

* Log-conformation tensor approach for the viscoelastic models.
* Solver for two-phase flows, using any GNF or VE fluid models for each phase.
* Wider range of tutorials to illustrate the application of the solvers to different problems.


## Compatibility

The development and testing of `rheoThermTool` was mainly
performed in [OpenFOAM v6](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-6) from the
[The OpenFOAM Foundation Ltd](https://openfoam.org/). It is, however, expected to
work with both [OpenFOAM v5.x](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-5.x)
and [OpenFOAM v4.x](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-4.x).
It is also expected to work with the ESI [OpenFOAM速](https://www.openfoam.com)
such as [OpenFOAM速 v1806](https://www.openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1806).

It was tested on a system running Debian Linux OS, version 9, in an x86_64 architecture and
with the GCC compiler version 6.3.0.


## Third-Party software

The following third-party software is used in `rheoThermTool`:

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).


## Installation

### Requirements

* Compatible and functional version of OpenFOAM or OpenFOAM速, already installed.
* Internet connection to download the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) C++ linear algebra library.

### Installation process

Assuming your OpenFOAM installation is located in a path
specified by variable `$OFDIR` (for example, `OFDIR=/opt/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-6`),
source the environment OpenFOAM variables and check if those are correct:
```sh
. $OFDIR/etc/bashrc

echo "WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR = $WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR"
echo "WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR = $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR"

echo "FOAM_USER_APPBIN = $FOAM_USER_APPBIN"
echo "FOAM_USER_LIBBIN = $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN"

echo "FOAM_APPBIN = $FOAM_APPBIN"
echo "FOAM_LIBBIN = $FOAM_LIBBIN"
```

Choose a directory where `rheoThermTool` will be installed.
A good candidate is `$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR` or equivalently `$FOAM_RUN/../`.
```sh
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
git clone https://github.com/cvr/rheoThermTool
cd rheoThermTool
```
With these instructions, `rheoThermTool` source code and tutorials
are located in `$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/rheoThermTool`.

Install Eigen and define the `$EIGEN_RHEO` variable with the corresponding path for its libraries:
```sh
./downloadEigen
EIGEN_RHEO=$(find $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/ThirdParty/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname "eigen*" | head -n 1)
export EIGEN_RHEO
```

Install `rheoThermTool`.
```sh
cd of60/src
./Allwmake 2>&1 | tee -a logAllwmake.out
```
Consult the `logAllwmake.out` file to understand if there were any installation problems.


### Test installation

Go to your run directory, copy the cylinder tutorial case and run it.
```sh
cd $FOAM_RUN
cp -r $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/rheoThermTool/of60/tutorials/cylinder ./

cd cylinder
blockMesh
mirrorMesh -noFunctionObjects -overwrite
rheoThermFoam
paraFoam
```


## Libraries compiled by `rheoThermTool`

The default location for the libraries of `rheoThermTool`
is the `$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN` directory.  The libraries are:

* `libThermFunModels.so`
* `libRheoThermConstitutiveEq.so`
* `libBCRheoThermTool.so`
* `libpostProcessingRheoThermTool.so`
* `libgaussDefCmpwConvectionSchemes.so`

To change the default location for the libraries,
at compilation time one may export the `FOAM_USER_LIBBIN`
environment variable and point it to a different location.
For example, if one requires the libraries are installed
at folder `$FOAM_LIBBIN` instead:
```sh
export WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR=$WM_PROJECT_DIR
export FOAM_USER_LIBBIN=$FOAM_LIBBIN

cd of60/src
./Allwmake 2>&1 | tee -a logAllwmake.out
```

## Change default location for `rheoThermTool` libraries and applications

To change the default location of libraries and applications,
at compilation time one may export the `WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR`,
`FOAM_USER_LIBBIN` and `FOAM_USER_APPBIN` environment variables,
pointing these to a different locations.
For example, to have `rheoThermTool` in a folder named
`/opt/rheoThermTool`:
```sh
mkdir -p /opt/rheoThermTool/lib
mkdir -p /opt/rheoThermTool/bin

export WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR=/opt/rheoThermTool
export FOAM_USER_LIBBIN=/opt/rheoThermTool/lib
export FOAM_USER_APPBIN=/opt/rheoThermTool/bin

cd of60/src
./Allwmake 2>&1 | tee -a logAllwmake.out
```
